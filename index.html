								<p>As can be seen in the number of letters in the LGBT(QUIA+) acronym, there is an abundance of language, labels, and identities associated with this community.  This language is not only vast, but constantly changing; words that used to be widely used and accepted, such as <i>transsexual,</i> are now often viewed negatively, while words like <i>queer</i> have been reclaimed by many. In a context where labels are so important, where they can give not only a name but also a sense of community for those who choose to use them, exploring the history behind these labels is valuable.</p>

                                <p>At the beginning of this six-week intensive research project, I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do, but I knew that I wanted to explore the creation and evolution of these words, specifically those words surrounding trans* identities. After a lot of thinking and reading, I finally landed on a set of questions to explore. <i><b>How was the word transgender first introduced? How has it changed since then? And how exactly are people defining this word?</b></i></p>
                                
                                <p>I begin to explore these questions in the next section, in a review of some of the literature on the history of these words. I show how the word arose in the context of medicalized language and how it, in a few different ways, was created and championed by queer people who sought to define their own experiences and name themselves. I also explore the various ways this word has been defined throughout its (relatively) short history since its introduction in the late 1960s. After my literature review, I also explore this word through an analysis of a range of definitions drawn from over 90 sources published between 1980 and 2010. Through these means, I show that the definition of this word is far from uncontested, and has been defined multiple different ways across this time period.</p>

                                <p>Trans* <sup>1</sup> experiences have existed throughout time and cultures, although with different language and understandings of identity.<sup>2</sup>  This project will focus specifically on the language that developed starting in America and Europe in the 20th century since this is where much of the language currently associated with the word <i>transgender</i> started to appear. </p>
                                
                                <p>Many words for trans* experiences were proposed and used prior to and at the beginning of the 20th century that are no longer used today. In the late 19th century, what we consider today as sexuality and gender identity were conflated, and understood with the popular theory of <i>inversion.</i> This theory held that people who we would now likely be labeled as gay men embody femininity, and gay women embody masculinity (Meyerowitz 2002, 14).Building off this idea of inversion, in 1910, Magnus Hirschfeld, a German sexologist, coined the word <i>transvestite.</i><sup>3</sup> He described transvestites as people with “the erotic urge for disguise” who were men that wore women’s clothing as a sort of sexual fetish (Stryker 2008, 16). It is from this history that the word <i>transsexual</i> arose. </p>

                                <p><font size="+1"><b>The Rise of the “Transsexual” </b></font></p>
                                
                                <p>The word <i>transsexual </i>is attributed to David Caldwell’s 1949 article, <i>Psychopathia Transexualis.</i><sup>4 </sup>He explains that “among both sexes are individuals who wish to be members of the sex to which they do not properly belong” and that “when an individual fails to mature according to his (or her) proper biological and sexological status, such an individual is psychologically (mentally) deficient. The psychological condition is in reality the disease” (Caldwell in Stryker & Whittle 2006, 40-41). Clearly, this early example of this word is based in medicalization and illness. Although coinage is generally attributed to Caldwell,<sup>5</sup> usage was popularized by Harry Benjamin in his texts such as <i>Transsexualism and Transvestism as Psycho-Somatic and Somato-Psychic Syndromes</i> which defines a transsexual as a person who experiences an “extreme degree of transvestism” where “a transformation of sex is the foremost desire” (Benjamin in Stryker & Whittle 2006, 46).</p>
                                
                                <p>These early understandings of the transsexual were strongly related to medicalization. For example, much of the early history of transsexuality is understood by “landmark” individuals, such as Lili Elbe, Dora Richter, and Michael Dillon, who were among the “firsts” to receive various “sex reassignment” surgeries. Most of the dialogue around transsexuality happened within medical institutions in the context of these surgeries. Early on, these surgeries were not conducted in America (where they were considered unnecessary and harmful), but by 1966 they started to be accepted as an important aspect of care (Stryker 2008, 73), in large part because of Benjamin, who argued that “the untreated transsexual patient is one of the unhappiest that any doctor can ever meet” and that surgery was important and necessary (Benjamin 1967, 428-429).</p>
                                
                                <p>The idea of the transsexual started to have more prominence and visibility in mainstream U.S. society after Christine Jorgensen was publicized as an assigned male-at-birth female who had “changed sex.” Although not the first to receive these medical interventions, she was the first to gain mainstream attention. She made headlines, including the front-page story in the <i>New York Daily News,</i> “Ex-GI Becomes Blonde Beauty” (Meyerowitz 2009, 62). Jorgensen’s media presence introduced concepts of the transsexual in mainstream culture, and prompted more sexologists and other scientists to focus on people like her. In addition to a very medicalized notion of the transsexual, Jorgensen’s fame also solidified conceptions of the transsexual as a middle class, white, traditionally feminine woman who was assigned male at birth (Skidmore 2011).</p>

                                <p>There is much to be said critiquing the medicalization of trans* bodies that began in the late 19th and throughout the 20th century, which in large part revolves around the creation of “the transsexual” in texts related to medicine and sexology. Early sexologists held assumptions of what “real” transsexuals looked like; they were understood as generally heterosexual or asexual people, who felt they were in the “wrong body” and were disgusted by their preoperative bodies (Stone 1992, 161-162). In turn, people who wanted access to these surgeries told doctors the stories they wanted to hear, in order to be believed. In “The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,” Sandy Stone explores this issue and explains that, “It took a surprisingly long time - several years - for the researchers to realize that the reason the candidates’ behavioral profiles matched Benjamin's so well was that the candidates, too, had read Benjamin's book” and “were only too happy to provide the behavior that led to acceptance for surgery” (Stone 1992, 161).  In addition, those who did not want medical intervention or surgery were left out of the narrative and made invisible. Narratives of medicalization still have visible impacts on the experiences of trans* people today.<sup>6</sup> These narratives were also what led a transgender activist, named Virginia Prince, to first describe herself as a <i>transgenderist.</i></p>

                                <p>Virginia Prince was a transgender woman who, although using hormones, never opted to receive genital surgery. The first time she used this word in print<sup>7</sup> is generally attributed to a piece she wrote in 1969, where she explains “I, at least, know the difference between sex and gender and have simply elected to change the latter and not the former. If a word is necessary, I should be termed a ‘transgenderal’” (Prince 1969 in Ekins & King 2004). She later replaced this word with “transgenderist” (Ekins & King 2004). Prince was acting in opposition to the medical narratives that told her that the only way she could be a true <i>transsexual</i> was through genital surgery. Rather than trying to fit that mold, she created a new category. She argues that it is not necessary to change one’s biological sex, which she equates heavily with genitalia, in order to change one’s gender, the way one presents in society and relates to other people (Ekins & King 2005, 5-15).</p>
                                
                                <p>There were some major problems in Prince’s definition of a “transgenderist.” Specifically, her writings focused exclusively on transgender women.<sup>8</sup> She was also judgmental of those who chose to have genital surgery, particularly those who were not interested in having sex with people with penises. She claimed that they were confused, and would “be just as happy and comfortable being transgenderists and saving a lot of money, a lot of pain and discomfort and the relatively high probability of further surgical experience” (Prince 2005, 45; originally  published in 1979). Despite her problems, Prince not only introduced and popularized the label of “transgender” but was also an important advocate for allowing trans* people to exist outside the medical narratives that had thus far shaped the discourse.</p>
                                
                                <p><font size="+1"><b>Multiple Definitions of Transgender</b></font></p>
                                
                                <p><i>Transgender</i> does not typically mean the same thing today as it did when Prince first began using it in 1960s and 70s. In their 2006 book, <i>The Transgender Phenomenon</i>, Richard Ekins and Dave King explore this changing meaning and propose four definitions of “transgender” (Ekins & King 2006). The first of these is Prince’s definition, which, although currently the least popular of the four, has left an important impact. It has been used by other authors such as Jay Prosser in 1998 in <i>Second Skins</i>, and even in some 21st century literature, such as an article published in 2013 about court definitions and understandings of trans* people (Gonzalez-Salzberg 2013, 801).</p>

                                <p><center><font size="-1"><i> Cropped image from David Barajas on Upsplash (https://unsplash.com/photos/oryVglc-wlg)</i></font></center></p>
                                
                                <p>The second definition of transgender is the one I came into this project the most associated with, which is transgender as an umbrella term “used to describe a wide range of gender-diverse people who do not feel that the gender assigned to them at birth was correct” (Meyorwitz 2009, 345). In this sense, <i>transgender</i> describes the categories that Prince referred to as <i>transsexual</i> and <i>transgender</i>, as well as a multitude of other identities. One of the earliest, if not the first, example of <i>transgender</i> being used academically in this way is in the essay <i>Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come</i>, by Leslie Feinberg who introduced the idea of a “transgender community” made up of “a diverse group of people who define [them]selves in many different ways” (Feinberg 1992 in Stryker & Whittle 2006, 206).</p>
                                
                                <p>As with Prince’s definition, this understanding of <i>transgender</i> as an umbrella term is not without criticism. Some authors, although in the minority, have argued that the words transgender and transsexual should remain separated (Prosser 1998, 176). Others, in a different vein, have argued that the label of transgender, while attempting to cover everyone’s identities, over emphasizes the role of binary, “passing,” trans-women and erases the experiences of other trans* people. These authors argue that “umbrellas don’t work well when one group holds them up” (Nestle, Howell, & Wilchins 2002, 59).</p>

                                <p>The third definition of “transgender” that Ekins and King explore is “Transgender as Transgression” or as transcendence (Ekins & King 2006, 14). They explain that this term “can be used in the overtly transgressive sense of ‘going beyond’ the binary divide, and, in some uses, of ‘going beyond’ gender altogether” (Ekins & King 2006, 12). This understanding of <i>transgender</i> is deeply rooted in gender and queer theory,<sup>9</sup> and can also be associated with the rise of the word <i>genderqueer,</i> which I will briefly explore near the end of this review. </p>
                                
                                <p>In 1991, Holly Boswell is one of the first to explicitly define transgender this way, describing it as “a viable option between crossdresser and transsexual person, which also happens to have a firm foundation in the ancient tradition of androgyny” which defies traditional gender norms while also embracing the wholistic set of trans* experiences (Boswell 1991, 29). This understanding of transgender places it as a state of in-betweenness that can question traditional understandings of gender. When transgender is defined this way, it is often associated with visibility, in opposition to passing.</p>
                                
                                <p>The final definition of transgender that Ekins and King give is as the field of “transgender studies” which attempts to “map the various constructions of transgender phenomena in terms of their origins, developments, interrelations and consequences” (Ekins & King 2006, 19).  This field focuses on understanding transgender history and current existence, and is where this project lies.</p>
                                
                                <p>In this review so far, I have explored the rise, and variety of meanings, of the word <i>transgender</i> in the context of other words such as <i>transvestite</i> and <i>transsexual.</i> Before moving into my specific research, it is important to note the existence of other words that came after this rise, specifically the term <i>genderqueer,</i> as well as to address some of the issues in the literature that I am exploring.</p>

                                <p>As with other trans* identities, the idea of genders that fall outside of the binary are by no means new, nor are they bound to American or European culture.<sup>10</sup> The word “genderqueer” itself arose out of much of the same literature that defined transgender as transgression. The actual coinage of this word is generally attributed<sup>11</sup> to Riki Wilchins in 1995, when she states</p>

                                <p>Finally, before launching into my specific project, I want to acknowledge that there are some major problems with the literature surrounding trans* identities. These problems may make their way into my work which, as I will explain, focuses on analyzing and exploring this very literature. To put it briefly, much of the academic work that exists, especially older works, prioritizes white, middle class, post-op, “passing” trans women, leaving many trans* people out of these narratives. In addition, this project focuses on Western, academic understandings of trans* identities, which is by no means a comprehensive lens to understand all trans* experiences.</p>

                                <li>In this project, I will be using the word trans* to describe the range of language/identities that describe non-cisgender people, including (but not limited to) the words transgender, transsexual, genderqueer, and nonbinary. Although this word is rooted in American and European discourse, I attempt to use it to describe those with similar experiences, across culture and time, even when this word would not be directly applied.</li>
                                
                                <li>For example, in the book Transgender: A Reference Guide, Aaron Devor & Ardel Haefele-Thomas explore pre-twentieth century trans* experiences in the section “From the Ancients to the 1700s - Recognition of Gender Diversity”: 9-16.</li>
                                
                                <li>Although far less common, this word is still used today, such as in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5, published in 2003, which includes “Transvestic Disorder”, which is associated with the sexual fetish described by Hirschfeld, in cases where it causes significant distress to an individual.</li>
                                
                                <li>For example, Stryker in Transgender History, 18 makes this attribution.</li>
                                
                                <li>There is some debate on who actually coined this word, for example, in The Transgender Studies Reader on page 40, authors explain that it was used even earlier by Magnus Hirschfeld, albeit in a different context. However, Caldwell first published this word with the definition that gained popularity.</li>
                                
                                <li>For example,  in 2013, Dean Spade, a trans* activist and writer, explored similar issues, including his personal experience of lying to doctors and psychologists in order to receive hormones and surgery: See Dean Spade, “Mutilating Gender” in Stryker & Whittle, The Transgender Studies Reader, 315-332</li>
                                
                                <li>There is some debate on who actually coined this word, for example, Dr John Oliven used the word in 1965 as a replacement for the word transsexual. However, Prince’s definition was the first to gain popularity and is the one most commonly associated with the coinage of the word. See Cristan Williams, “Transgender,” Transgender Studies Quarterly 1, no. 1 (2014): 233</li>
                                
                                <li>Prince, as well as other writers of her time, was rather inconsistent with what she meant when she said “transgender” or “transsexual” men or women, and often referred to the sex/gender assigned at birth. When I use these phrases in my writing, however, I am referring to one’s gender identity, not one’s gender assigned at birth.</li>
                                
                                <li>For example, Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble, which explores gender as performative, was an important piece in the development of this understanding.</li>
                                
                                <li>As an example of a non-western understanding of a genderqueer experience, the word Two-Spirit was adopted at the 1990 Third Annual Inter-Tribal Native American, First Nations, Gay and Lesbian American Conference to describe a variety of identities of gender and sexuality that fall outside of the Western binary. See Devor & Haefele-Thomas, Transgender, 8</li>

                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/transflag.png" alt="transgender flag" /></span>
                                
								<p>Briefly, this project utilizes a variety of different sources published between 1980 and 2010 to explore the way the word <i>transgender</i> has been defined within academic literature in this time period. Ideally, I would have been able to widen this time range to be more broad, but due to the time limitations of this project, I focused on this time period. Much of the literature I read pointed to the 90s as a time where great change happened in respect to this language, and so I decided to focus my project on this decade, as well as those on either side of it. Specifically, for every year in this range, I examined the top five most cited results that show up in a Google Scholar search with the word “transgender” in the title. I searched each work for a definition of “transgender.”</p>
                                
                                <p>Some years, particularly in the 80s, had few to no results that came up in this search. In addition, in some cases, the referenced articles were not available or accessible. In these cases, I used the next most-cited piece. This way of collecting definitions allowed me to explore works from a wide range of years, which were influential enough to be cited, and which explicitly related to the word “transgender.”</p>
                                
                                <p>In the next section, I will go more in depth describing how I created this database of definitions, and explore the types of sources these definitions were drawn from. I will also provide a link to a full list of these definitions, as well as their sources, for anyone interested in looking at them directly.</p>
                                
                                <p>The goal of creating this database was to explore the questions:</p>
                                  
                                <ul>
                                   <li>How has the definition of the word transgender changed over time?</li>
                                    <li>What are the main ways it is being defined in academic literature?</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>These questions were explored using a combination of close readings and the text analysis tool <i>Voyant.</i></p>

								<p>As stated before, I started creating my database of definitions by searching Google Scholar for of all articles which included the word “transgender” in the title and selecting the top cited sources per year (between 1980 and 2010). Unfortunately, Google Scholar does not allow users to sort by citations. Therefore, I used a free software program, <i>Publish or Perish</i><sup>1</sup>. Using this program, I was able to create a database of all of the Google Scholar results which included the word “transgender” in the title during this time period, sorted by the number of times they had been cited, and then select the top five sources from each year.</p>

                                <p>Before going specifically into the definitions, I want to give a basic overview of the corpus I selected from. As can be seen in the graph below, as time goes on, more and more pieces are being published with the word “transgender” in the title. This shows itself in my database of definitions since, in the 80s and early 90s, there are very few pieces available, and so there are multiple years where I am not able to select five sources.</p> 
                                    
                                  <a href="images/OverallFreq.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/OverallFreq.png" alt="Overall Frequencies"></span></a>

                               <p>In an effort to further understand the corpus that I was drawing from, I decided to explore the topic of these works by reading through the titles and sources of many of these pieces and creating a list of these topics or themes. I then coded the top 50 most cited sources per year to get a better idea of what kinds of things these sources were discussing. One source could be coded as multiple topics. The following graph shows the frequencies of the most common topics. <p> 
                                
                                 <a href="images/Most%20common%20topics.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/Most%20common%20topics.png" alt="Most Common Topics"></span></a>
                               
                              
                             <p>These categories are relatively self-explanatory, but I will briefly explain each. </p>
                    <ul>
                        
                        <li><b>Health & Medicine:</b> Pieces related to health, medicine, surgery, and AIDS, etc. </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Education:</b> Pieces which discussed the importance of safety and inclusion within schools, and methods to achieve this.</li>
                        
                        <li><b>Youth:</b> Pieces which focus on children and teenagers.</li>

                        <li><b>Law:</b> Pieces which focused on laws and civil rights.</li>
                        
                        <li><b>Violence/Discrimination:</b> Pieces that explored negative experiences that trans* people might experience due to bias.</li>
                        
                       <li><b>Cross-Cultural:</b> Pieces which explicitly focus on non-American contexts.</li>
                        
                        <li><b>Family:</b> Pieces which focus on families and people attempting to create families.</li>
                        
                      <li><b>Social Services:</b> Pieces which focused on public outreach programs or issues of homelessness.</li>
                        
                     <li><b>Sexuality:</b> Pieces which focused on sexual behavior (including articles on sex-work).</li>  
                        
                        <li><b>Aging:</b> Pieces which focus on elderly individuals or the process of aging.</li>
                        
                        <li><b>History:</b> Pieces which focused on the history of various identities/experiences.</li>
                        
                                </ul>

                <p>Finally, I explored whether pieces were from sources explicitly related to LGBT+ identities and experiences, or from other fields (such as psychology or public health). In order to save time, and because of the fact that many of the results provided by Publish or Perish did not have the full journal name included, I chose to only look at the source for the articles that I selected (five per year) to use for definitions. There was a near even split between the two types of sources, although there were slightly more works from explicitly LGBT+ sources.</p>
                                
        
                                 <a href="images/Does%20the%20Piece%20Come%20from%20an%20LGBT+%20Source_.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/Does%20the%20Piece%20Come%20from%20an%20LGBT+%20Source_.png" alt="Source Type"></span></a>

            <p>As stated before, I selected the top five most cited sources per year to explore in greater depth. This selection process was limited by the sources I was able to access in a short period of time, and so in some cases I was required to choose the next most cited source when one was not available. In the few instances where there were multiple inaccessible sources, I continued through the list until I either had five sources, or until I had exhausted the list. In situations where there were multiple sources tied for one citation, I included pieces over the five work limit, since I did not want to arbitrarily choose between two pieces. As such, there are two years where I have 6 pieces to analyze, rather than 5. In addition, some years (especially in the 80s) did not have any sources, or had less than five. In those cases, I simply used as many sources as were available. </p>
                                
            <p><font size= “+1”><b>Finding Definitions</b></font></p>
                                
            <p>Once I had access to these sources, I went through them and looked for where the author(s) defined the word “transgender.” Most of these pieces explicitly gave a definition of the word, either in the introduction, methods section, a glossary, or even in the notes. Other definitions were more implicit. Some of these pieces however, did not define the word at all. There were a variety of reasons why authors left “transgender” undefined. In some instances, the word transgender was only included as a letter in the LGBT acronym, and the piece primarily focused on sexuality. In other contexts, it seemed that the authors simply assumed that the word did not need to be explained, and was already known to the reader. </p>
                                
            <p>Once I had compiled this list of definitions, I began to explore them in a variety of ways. I will explain my data analysis more specifically in the next section, but, briefly, I used both text analysis and close reading to try to understand the way these definitions changed over time. I also explored whether or not they were different dependent on their topic of their article and whether or not they came from an LGBT+ source. </p>

                                <p>To begin analyzing these definitions, I put them into Voyant<sup>1</sup> in order to do a basic analysis of the text. The image below is a word cloud that represents the words most commonly used in these definitions, once certain stop words (such as “transgender”  and variations on the word “define,” and “individual” were removed).</p>

                                <p>A few categories of ideas can be seen in this image. One of the most commonly used words is "transsexual." Based on close readings of the text, this often shows up as a category of inclusion when discussing what identities fall under the "umbrella" of transgender. "Sex" is also a very common word, which is most often used in the context of "biological" sex, and shows that many of these pieces refer to this biological sex/sex-assigned-at-birth as a part of this definition. The word "cross" is very common, and is used related to the context of "cross dress" as well as "crossing between genders." Many other words and themes can be seen by examining this cloud, which gives a general, if incomplete, overview of these definitions.</p>

                                <p>Next, I examined these definitions as they changed over the years. One of the initial goals of this project was to see how the definition of the word <i>transgender</i> has changed over time, and so this was an important part of my project. The following images show this text analysis. I selected the words that I analyzed through a combination of drawing from the Voyant word cloud and choosing what might be interesting based on some of the literature that I have read. The results are broken into three images to make them more understandable.

                                <p>The overall pattern that I found through this text analysis was that there wasn’t really a pattern. Certain search terms, specifically “queer,” “Andro*|genderqueer” and “Transcend*|transgress” appeared more commonly after 2005 but, on the whole, despite variation between years, there were no clear patterns to this variation. In addition to those pictured, I looked at  other words, as well as ways of visualizing and analyzing these definitions, and they all showed me the same result; there were no obvious change in the way these authors defined the word "transgender" over time.</p>

                                <p>The next step for me was to move away from Voyant and focus on a close reading of these definitions. I decided to do this close reading because I could pick up on subtleties that distant text analysis could not. For example, when counting the word “transsexual,” distant text analysis cannot tell the difference between a quote that explains, as a hypothetical example, “transgender is a category that includes individuals such as transsexuals” and one that explains “transgender people, unlike transsexuals, do not undergo genital surgery.” These are clearly two very different definitions, but they both include the word “transsexuals.” For this close reading, I drew upon three of the four definitions that Ekins and King (2006) provide of the word “transgender” as well as the category of “other” and “no definition.” The categories were as such:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                
                                <li><b>Type 1: Prince’s Definition:</b> This definition describes the word “transgender” in opposition to the term “transsexual.” One is transgendered (or a “transgenderist”) if they live as the “opposite” gender, but have not had surgery to “change sex.” This is the definition that Virginia Prince, who is often credited with coining the word “transgender” used. </li>
                                    
                                    <li><b>Type 2: Umbrella:</b> This definition understands the word “transgender” as an umbrella term that includes a wide range of identities which fall outside of normative experiences and expressions of gender.</li>
                                    
                                    <li><b>Type 3: Transcendence:</b> This definition understands the word “transgender” as describing individuals who, through visible refusal to conform to traditional gender norms, may transcend gender and begin to break down the binary. </li>
                                    
                                    <li><b>Type 4: Other:</b> This category covers any definition of the word “transgender” that cannot be classified as any of the above three definitions. Therefore, this category acts as a “none-of-the-above” group.</li>
                                    
                                    <li><b>No Definition:</b> Any piece that did not contain a definition of the word “transgender” was coded into this category. </li>
                                    
                                
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>I chose to exclude Ekins and King’s fourth definition, transgender as a field of study, as a definition type, simply because I knew from reading the definitions that this category was not applicable to any of the data.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p>When coding these definitions, some quotes fell into multiple categories and were coded as such. An example of a definition that was counted as multiple definitions, in this case all of the first three, is  below. </p>
                                
                                <blockquote>“It can refer to 'any kind of dress and/or behavior interpreted as "transgressing" gender roles.' It has been used more narrowly within the subculture as an umbrella term uniting transvestites and transsexuals as the transgender community. More narrowly still, it has been used to refer to those who live full-time in the 'opposite' gender but without surgery” (Ekins & King 1997, para. 10).</blockquote>
                                
                                <p>Some of these definitions were more common than others. As can be seen in the chart below, authors most commonly defined "transgender" as an umbrella term. The categories of “transcendent,” “other” and “no definition” were about even in their frequency. Prince’s definition of the word was by far the least common, and was only found in five out of ninety-five sources.</p>

                                <p>In addition, I broke the “other” category  into the definition types in the graph shown below. These types were exclusive, and so each definition could only fall into one of these groups.</p>
                                
                                 <a href="images/Other.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/Other.png" alt="Other Definitions"></span></a>
                                
                                <p> The most common “other” definition, was “incongruence” which includes definitions such as the one below. </p>
                                
                                <blockquote>“People who feel that their gender identity is different from their biological sex. Some transgender people wish to change their anatomy to be more congruent with their self-perception. Others do not have such a desire. There is no correlation between sexual orientation and transgender issues” (Smith 1995, 112).</blockquote>
                                
                                <p>This definition simply refers to a difference between sex/gender assigned at birth and gender identity. Other definitions focused specifically on the experience of discomfort or dysphoria, or on specific behaviors or the breaking of stereotypes that transgender people do. The final definition type is that transgender people actually reinforce gender binaries by playing into traditional gender roles and misunderstanding what it truly means to be a woman. The categories “stereotypes,” “behavior,” and “reinforces binary” were made up of only one definition each. </p>

                                <p>Once all the definitions were coded by definition type, I examined the frequency that each was used per year. These frequencies can be seen in the following graph (click on it to get a clearer view). Reflecting the results from my preliminary text analysis, there is no clear pattern to show that these definitions are changing over time. This supports my previous findings; as far as I can tell, within the time period that I am exploring, the definition of the word “transgender” has not changed much, or at least not in any of the ways I have thought to look at. </p>

                                <p>Since I didn’t find any patterns that showed the definition of “transgender” has changed over time, I decided to see if other factors were related to how this word was defined. Since I had already coded each definition according to the “topic” of the title of the piece, I decided to use this as one way of analyzing these definitions. Among the defined words, the most common topics were <i>education, health & medicine, psychology, violence,</i> and <i>youth.</i></p> 
                                
                                <p>I ran the definitions through Voyant again, this time organized by topic. It should be noted that some articles had multiple topics, and so are included multiple times in this analysis. Other definitions, whose titles’ did not fall into any of these categories, were not included at all.</p>
                                
                                <a href="images/VoyantTopic1.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/VoyantTopic1.png" alt="Voyant Topic 1"></span></a>
                                
                                  <p>The image above shows part of this Voyant search (to better view the image, click on it and you will be brought to a larger image in a new tab). This image shows what I found to be interesting results. Specifically, the word "sex," which, in this context typically refers to biological or birth sex, was by far the most often used in the topic psychology, followed by Health & Medicine and was used less often in the categories Youth and Education. A similar pattern can be seen with the word "surg* (surgery/surgeries). On the other hand, the search terms “Transvest*|dress*|crossdress*” and “drag” showed the opposite pattern, and were more common in the topics of youth and education, as was the word "transsexual". These patterns did not seem to map onto the category relating to violence and discrimination.</p>
                                
                                <p>The word "sex" implies talking about the biological and physical aspects of the body, and the word "surgery" relates, clearly, to medical changes to these bodies. Words like crossdress and drag, on the other hand, refer more to expressions of gender, particularly those focused on clothing.</p>
                                
                                <p>Bringing this all together, it seems that in the contexts of psychology, and health & medicine, it is more common to talk about the physical and medicalized aspects of the transgender body. In the context of education and youth, on the other hand, it seems less common to discuss these ideas, and more common to discuss ideas related to gender expression and presentation. I am unsure what the pattern related to the word "transsexual" is representing. </p>

                                <p>The remaining terms I examined, as shown above, were relatively consistent across these topics.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p>I also, as can be seen in the following graph, looked at whether or not certain definition types were more common in certain topics. These results are reported as relative to the total frequency of definitions for each topic, since some had many more definitions than others.</p>
                                
                                 <a href="images/DefTypeTopic.png" target="_blank"><span class="image main"><img src="images/DefTypeTopic.png" alt="Definition types by topic"></span></a>
                                
                                
                                <p>What immediately stood out to me about this graph was that the highest definition type in psychology was “other.” In addition, the category "other" was most frequent in psychology, and this was, in fact, the only topic where the category of "other" was more common than the definition "umbrella." 
                                    
                                After some consideration, I realized that this supports my observations from the Voyant graphs. The most common “other” definition simply defines transgender as the incongruence between biological/birth sex and gender identity, and the second most common defines it as a sense of dysphoria and discomfort. These two definitions combined accounted for roughly 70% of those definitions in the "other" category. These definitions also seem related to the word "sex" (in order to refer to this incongruency, many definitions used referenced biological or birth sex), as well as to the idea of surgery, since dysphoria or discomfort with one's body is one of the most commonly discussed reasons why a trans* person might choose to undergo these procedures.</p>
                                    
                                
                                <p>The topics health & medicine and psychology were the most likely to provide some definition of the word "transgender." This makes sense, in order to discuss an idea in a scientific context, it often needs to be operationally defined.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p>The final  pattern I noticed is that the topic of “psychology” is the only one to have mentioned Prince’s definition. I am not quite sure what to make of this observation. Since the use of Prince’s definition is, overall, very low, this may be a coincidence.</p>

                                <p>In addition to exploring whether or not these definitions changed depending on the topic the article was about, I also wanted to explore if pieces from explicitly LGBT sources defined this word differently than those from other sources. To do so, I first looked at these definitions in Voyant, using the same key words as in the previous sections.</p>

                                <p>This showed some interesting differences. The word “identity” (and various versions of it) showed up more often in non-LGBT sources, as did the word “sex” and, to a lesser extent, “queer” and “drag.” I am not exactly sure what to make of these patterns. I would think that the difference in the word “sex” was for a similar reason as it being more common in psychology, with more articles focusing on sex/gender incongruence than presentation or behavior, but the higher usage of the word “drag” seems to contradicts this hypothesis. The fact that queer is more common in non-LGBT sources was surprising, since this is, in my experience, a term more often used by people who identify as queer than by those who do not because of its status as a reclaimed slur. I am similarly unsure on why non-LGBT sources discussed the idea of identity more often than LGBT sources. The only word that was more commonly discussed in LGBT sources was the word “community” (and various versions of it). This would make sense that sources dedicated to research or discussion of the LGBT community would have a greater focus on the concept of community itself. Overall, although some differences did show up in the frequencies of these words, I was not able to make sense of why these differences occurred. </p>
                                
                                
                                <p>I also looked at how the relative frequency of the definitions type changed depending on whether or not the source was explicitly LGBT. These relative frequencies can be seen in the following graph as can be seen in the following graph.</p>

                                <p>All of the discussions of Prince’s definition came from LGBT sources, which may imply that these sources were more likely to define the word "transgender" in historical context. It could also mean that they simply paid greater credence to Prince than other sources. Otherwise, the relative frequencies of these definitions were more-or-less the same across these two types of sources.</p>

                                <p>Through a combination of text analysis and close reading, I explored in what situations the word “transgender” was being defined differently. I found that, overall, the definition of the word did not really change over time, at least within the time period that I was able to look at. LGBT sources and non-LGBT sources defined this word in slightly, although not dramatically. different ways. There were some larger differences in the definitions of this word across different topics, specifically between the topics of “education,” “violence,” “health & medicine,” “psychology,” and “youth.”</p>

                                <p>Overall, I did not expect what I found. In my original framing of this question, and in the way that the LGBT+ community is often discussed, I had strong expectations about change over time. This was based on the idea that, as time passes, people’s language is improving, becoming more tolerant and inclusive, or, just in general, changing. Therefore, I expected that the definitions that authors provided of the word “transgender” would be different depending on when they were written. As made clear in my results, however, I found no such change. For example, consider the two definitions below. Despite being written fourteen years apart (the first in 1995 and the second in 2009), they share a great deal of similarity.</p>
                                
                                <blockquote>“There is a range of people who identify as transgender: people who are transsexual, people who are into "gender-bending," drag queens, and so on. In short, many who do not fit within the rigid confines of our society's gender norms consider themselves transgender” (Shepard 1995, 18-19). </blockquote>
                                
                                <blockquote>“That is, I use it here as an umbrella term that refers to all identities or practices that cross over, cut across, move between, or otherwise queer socially constructed sex/gender boundaries. The term includes, but is not limited to, transsexuality, heterosexual transvestism, gay drag, butch lesbianism, and such non-European identities as the Native American berdache or the Indian Hijra. Like 'queer,' 'transgender' may also be used as a verb or an adjective” (Stryker 2009, 94).</blockquote>
                                
                                <p>Based on this evidence, it seems that, at least within the context of my project, the definition of the word “transgender”  has not really changed. Based on this, I think that it may be less accurate to describe the definition of transgender as “changing” and more accurate to say that it has multiple meanings, or that it is inconsistently defined.</p>
                                
                                <p>This concept is in line with the fact that I did find some differences in definition depending on the topic of the piece that defined the word, and on the type of source that it came from. Different people, in different contexts, define this word differently, in a way that cannot be explained by a changing of the word over time. </p>
                                
                                <p>These differences based on topic were particularly interesting to me. When I think of the word "definition" I think of it as being relatively certain. The point of a definition, it seems, is to make sure that everyone is on the same page about what a word means. It would make sense if this definition changed over time; over two-thirds of the articles I found may not have provided a definition of transgender had it been a word with a well-established, consistent definition. However, this is not the case. The definitions of this word did not change as a factor of time but rather, perhaps, as a factor of the context in which it is defined. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>It makes sense that different fields would talk about this term in different ways, for example, that articles related to medicine or psychology would focus less on gender expression and presentation than those focusing on youth and education. However, it is interesting that these differences show themselves, not just in the text as a whole, but in the definition, which is generally thought of as being more "definite" and consistent.  </p>

                                <p>There are multiple ways I would have loved to expand this project if I had had the time, and ways that these ideas could be explored further. First, it would be interesting to expand the time range used in this project. This would allow me to see if this sense of ambiguity and multiplicity of definitions continue to show itself. It would also let me look at older articles, although doing so would require a different search method, since even the earlier years of my current time range had few to no results. I would likely find some patterns over time if I were able to look earlier, since many of the definitions of this word were first used in the 1990s, decades after the word was first introduced.</p>
                                
                                <p>In addition, given the opportunity and the time, I would look at more than five definitions per year. This would allow me to be more confident that the patterns that I observe reflect on the greater collection of articles. It also means that any patterns that do exist would be more likely to be evident.</p>
                                
                                <p>In addition to broadening the number of sources and the range of years I looked at, it would also be interesting to do a similar analysis for other words used to describe the trans* community, such as <i>transsexual</i> and <i>genderqueer.</i> I am curious to see if these words are also defined in a multitude of different ways, or if they have more consistent definitions. I expect that the word <i>transsexual</i> might be more consistently defined since it was introduced by doctors who, from the very beginning, carefully defined it. I don’t really have much of a prediction for what I would find if I explored the definitions related to the word <i>genderqueer</i> which makes the idea of doing this exploration even more interesting. </p>
                                
                                <p>I would also like to do a more in depth analysis of these definitions as a factor of what topic the source they are from focuses on, since this is the area in which I found most of the differences. Although I was able to examine this, this was a way of exploring the definitions that came up after the definitions had been collected. The database that I created was not necessarily intended for this analysis, hence the reason that a good deal of the sources did not fall into any of the coded categories. One way that I could expand in this direction is by gathering sources from particular journals which focused on particular topics, such as psychology, medicine, education, and other broad categories. This would allow me to explore the way these fields define “transgender.” I could combine this with my exploration of “source type” by including “queer or LGBT+ studies” as a topic to explore.</p>
                                
                                <p>Finally, I would like to see if this multiplicity of definitions of the word “transgender” exists in the “real world” outside the realm of academia and published work. Specifically, my research shows that, in academia, not every author who defines the word "transgender" is giving the same definition. Is this true in the “real world” as well?</p>
                                
                                <p>Is there a sense of confusion as to the "real" definition of the word <i>transgender</i> that people experience or notice in their lives? Do LGBTQ+ (and specifically transgender) people define this word differently than their straight and cisgender counterparts?</p>
                                
                                <p>Shifting this focus from an analysis of published works to exploring the definitions of this word that people are using in their day-to-day lives would be an interesting and important step for this project.</p>

                                <b>The transgender community is exceedingly diverse. It includes transsexuals who completely live as members of the other biological sex. Transsexuals submit their bodies to painful procedures such as surgery and electrolysis and take hormones as part of their process of self-invention. Transgenderists differ. While their commitment to physical change is perhaps less extreme, they identify predominantly and often entirely with the other biological sex. There are heterosexuals who dress up in the privacy of their homes or congregate with others like themselves at transgender conventions and gay bars as well as cross-dressers who identify as gay. Prostitutes, too, cross-dress both to please themselves and to make money. Within each of these categories are biological females and males.

Recently, it has been suggested by members of the gender community that transgendersit be used to include transsexuals as a sub-category for legal purposes.

I realize that in doing so, and by including transsexuality (which I discuss in more detail below) within the transgender rubric, I am already taking a position in the debate about how these terms interrelate.

                                    Terms like 'transgender' and 'cross-gender' imply the mixing or crossing over of two reified attributes—masculinity and femininity. These terms assume that a coherent gender exists and is transcended, rather than reflect the process whereby nodes of masculinity and femininity are created and consequently contested, manipulated, and transformed. The idea that masculinity and femininity are self-evident entities (albeit culturally varied) that can be blended, leading to a third gender, reinforces the essentialist binaries that contemporary theorists are trying to deconstruct (pg. 39).</b></p>

                    The word 'transgender' itself which seems to have been coined in the 1980s, took on its current meaning in 1992 after appearing in the title of a small but influential pamphlet by Leslie Feinberg ... transgender came to mean something else entirely - an adjective rather than a noun. Feinberg called for a political alliance between all individuals who were marginalized or oppressed due to their difference from social norms of gendered embodiment, and who should therefore band together in a struggle for social, political, and economic justice. Transgender, in this sense, was a 'pangender' umbrella term for an imagined community encompassing transsexuals, drag queens, butches, hermaphrodites, cross-dressers, masculine women, effeminate men, sissies tomboys, and anyone else willing to be interpolated by the term who felt compelled to answer the call to mobilization (pg. 4).</b></p>

                    Transgender is an umbrella term used to describe people whose self-identification or expression transgresses established gender categories or boundaries. People who identify as transgender or 'trans' live all or a substantial portion of their lives expressing or presenting a gender identity (i.e. an internal sense of gender) that is other than their birth sex. The term transgender is inclusive of individuals who identify as transsexuals (i.e. identify with a gender different from their birth sex), cross-dressers (i.e., wear clothes usually associated with a gender other than their birth sex), and gender blenders (i.e. present ambiguous gender expressions).

                    The term transgender relates to a diversity of practices that call into question traditional ways of seeing gender and its relationship with sex and sexuality. Used broadly, the concept of transgender is extensive – incorporating practices and identities such as transvestism, transsexuality, intersex, gender queer, female and male drag, cross-dressing and some butch/femme practices. Transgender may refer to individuals who have undergone hormone treatment or surgery to reconstruct their bodies, or to those who cross gender in ways that are less permanent. Transgender has also been referred to as ‘gender blending’, ‘gender mixing’, ‘gender fucking’ and ‘gender crossing’. In this book ‘transgender’ is used as an umbrella term to cover a diversity of practices that involve embodied movements across, between, or beyond the binary categories of male and female. My use of the term ‘transgender’ thus relates to transsexual identities and practices, and those that are articulated from a variety of other (trans) gender positions (pg. 1). </b></p>

Others use the word to describe a gender outside the constructs of male/female, to describe the experience of having no gender or multiple genders: examples include people who define themselves as 'genderqueer,' 'androgyne,' 'gender bender,' 'beyond binary,' and 'polygender' (pg. 333). </b></p>

                    Transgender is an umbrella term that is broadly used to describe people with gender identities, expressions or behaviors which differ from their biological sex at birth. Although the term transgender is sometimes used synonymously with transsexual, the latter more commonly describes a subset of transgender individuals who undergo gender reassignment surgery and/or hormone treatment to align physical sex and gender identity. For varying reasons that include cost and lack of access to appropriate health care services, an unknown proportion of transgender people do not elect to obtain surgery or hormonal therapies. Terms such as “genderqueer” are increasingly used by younger transgender people, as well as some who do not identify as transgender, to describe a wide range of gender identiﬁcations, behaviors and expressions other than exclusively male or female (pg. 14).</b></p>

                    Transgenderism is a rare phenomenon that may be described as an incongruence between biological or anatomical sex and gender identity. Male-to-female (MTF) transgender persons, the focus of this study, are born with male genitalia and medically assigned as 'male' at birth but subsequently develop a sense of themselves as 'female,' or at least partially female, in certain situations or roles. A small but probably increasing percentage of these individuals undergo sexual reassignment surgery in an attempt to render their sexual characteristics and gender identity more compatible (pg. 12). </b></p>
